Animations Editor
=================

Probably, the most common animations in Phaser_ games are the so called sprite-animations or frame-based animations.

Animation:

  :alt: Eagle animation.

Animation frames:

 In Phaser_ v3, the animations are created as global objects, in the `animations manager`_.
