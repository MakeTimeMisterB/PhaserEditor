Workbench Overview
==================

Phaser Editor is based on the Eclipse IDE and shares a lot of the concepts and features. In this chapter we explain some key concepts that are common to modern editors and IDEs but could be different in Phaser Editor.

The Eclipse IDE is a general purpose tool that is open, flexible and powerful. Maybe for this reason it could result complex to some users to perform certain tasks, but we belive that we can customize and transform the Eclipse IDE in a tool more friendly and productive for game development.

When you run the editor it opens the workbench in the selected workspace. The workbench contains windows, and each window contains views, editors, main toolbar and main menu. All these elements are grouped and layout in a perspective, and you can switch from one perspective to other. Different windows may contains different perspective.

Views
-----

A view is a small window, or better say, a **part**, inside the workbench window. They are commonly used to present the information of certain resource (workspace, project or file). A view may have a menu or/and a toolbar, with commands that only affects the view's content.

Most of the view are about to navigate content or show the properties of an object. However, some views allow to edit content, but that content is modified at the moment, there is not the **dirty** concept available in editors. A view may persists its state in the workspace metadata.

You can add, close, stack, dock, minimize/maximize views. The views layout are part of the perspective and is persisted across sessions or perspective switching.

Editors
-------

The editors are, like the views, **parts** of the workbench window. You can close, add, stack, dock, minimize/maximize editors, but the editor layout are not part of the perspective. This means, when you switch to other perspective, the editors remains open.

Editors have input. The common input of an editor is a file. The editors have a **dirty** state, that is activated when the content is modified but not saved. When you close the workbench, if an editor is **dirty** then a confirmation dialog is shown.

An editor can contribute items to the `main toolbar <#the-main-toolbar>`_. When an editor is activated the center of the toolbar is filled with its contributions.

Perspectives
------------

A perspective groups views and menu items with the goal of focus a series of related tasks. For example, the `Scene perspective <#scene>`_ provides the views to better design scenes and related assets.

The layout of the views and the editor area is persisted in the perspective across sessions. If you change the layout, the perspective is modified. Actually, you can reset a perspective or save its layout as a new perspective. 

In the `Window â†’ Perspective` menu is listed the operations you can do with perspectives (Open, Customize, Save As, Reset, Close, Close All). In addition, in the toolbar you can do a few of them:

1. Open a view.
2. Reset the perspective.
3. Switch to other perspective.
